"""Symbolic detour.

It is straighforward to symbolize existing classes and functions, but in order
to use them, we need to replace the classes that were used in existing code
with the symbolic ones. Sometimes, we just cannot modify existing source code.
Or in some other cases, objects created within a function or a class method are
not exposed to the external, therefore we cannot manipulate them as a part of
the symbolic tree. For example::

  @pg.symbolize
  def foo():
    # Object `a` is not a part of `foo`'s interface,
    # therefore it cannot be seen from the symbolic tree
    # that contains a `foo` object.
    a = A(1)
    return a.do_something()

Symbolic detour is introduced to address these use cases, which redirects
the ``__new__`` method of a class to another class or function when itâ€™s
evaluated under a context manager. Symbolic detour is not dependent on
symbolization, so in theory it can be used for detouring any classes.
Therefore, it does not require the presence of symbolic objects for mutating
the program.

    mappings: Sequence[Tuple[
        Type[Any],                               # Source class

  """Context manager for detouring object creation.

  At times, we want to replace an object of a class to an object of a different
  class. Usually, we do so by passing the object as a function argument using
  dependency injection. However, it's not always possible to expose those
  internal objects as parameters to the class, as we cannot predict what needs
  to be customized in future. Also, exposing too many arguments will hurt
  usability, it's big burden to figure out 20 arguments of a function for a user
  to get started.

  `pg.detour` provides another option for object replacement in Python, which
  creates a context in which some source classes can be detoured to specified
  destination classes or functions. For example, the code snippet below will
  detour instantation of class A to class B, and vice-versa::

    class A:
      pass

    class B:
      pass

    # Exchange class A and class B.
    with pg.detour([(A, B), (B, A)]):
      a = A()   # a is a B object.
      b = B()   # b is an A object.

  Detour destination can be a function, which allows users to intercept the
  arguments passed to the class constructor. For example::

    class Foo:
      def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    class Bar:
      def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def detoured_foo(cls, value):
      # cls is the original class before detour.
      return Bar(value + 1)

    with pg.detour([(Foo, detoured_foo)]):
      f = Foo(1)   # f will be Bar(2).

  Detour can be nested. The outer scope mappings take precedence over the
  mappings from the inner loop, allowing users to change object creation
  behaviors from the outside. For example, the following code will detour
  class A to class C::

    with pg.detour([(A, C)]):
      with pg.detour([A, B]):
        a = A()   # a is a C object.

  Detour is transisive across the inner and outer scope. For example, the code
  below will detour class A to class C through B::

    with pg.detour([(B, C)]):
      a1 = A()     # a1 is an A object.
      with pg.detour([A, B]):
        a2 = A()    # a2 is a C object. (A -> B -> C)

  Detour is thread-sfe.

  Args:
    mappings: A sequence of tuple (src_cls, dest_cls_or_fn) as mappings for the
      detour - 'src_cls' is the source class to be detoured, while
      'dest_cls_or_fn' is the destination class or function. When it's a class,
      its `__init__` method should have the same signature as the `__init__` of
      the original class. When it's a function, it should accept a positional
      argument `cls`, for passing the original class that is being detoured,
      followed by all the arguments that the original class should accept. For
      example, a class with `__init__(self, x, *args, y, **kwargs)` can be
      detoured to a function with signature `(cls, x, *args, y, **kwargs)`.

  Yields:
    Resolved detour mappings.

  Raises:
    TypeError: If the first item in each mapping is not a class, or the second
      item in each mapping is neither a class nor a function.
