  See http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.cec02.pdf for the
  original paper.

  NOTE(daiyip): PyGlove supports search spaces that do not change during
  exploration. Therefore we do not grow the program (e.g. Neural Architecture
  in the paper) from a minimal program. Also, crossover can take place on any
  two individuals due to a fixed program structure, which will be implemented
  later. This algorithm illustrates how speciation is expressed in the
  compositional evolution framework.

  Args:
    mutator: Mutator to use.
    population_size: Population size for each generation.
    disjoint_coefficient: Coefficient for DNA disjointness. Used for distance
      computations.
    matching_coefficient: Coefficient for DNA matching. Used for distance
      computations.
    compatibility_threshold: Threshold for max distances between two DNA in
      the same species.
    remaining_ratio: Ratio of best individuals in a species to remain.
    seed: Random seed. If None, use the current system time.

  Returns:
    An `Evolution` object that represents the NEAT algorithm.
